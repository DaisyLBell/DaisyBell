             Inflammatory Bowel Disease is an autoimmune disease that affects patients’ overall quality of life. Treatment in the clinical setting largely focuses on pharmaceutical solutions to achieve remission, often forgetting about lifestyle habits. This is also found in research inquiry, which largely ignores the validity of complementary medicine. However, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine in connection with the German Crohn’s Colitis Foundation and the Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine at the Kliniken Essen Mitte found that lifestyle changes can improve patients’ overall quality of life (Langhorst et al, 2020). This study suggests that patients would benefit from complementary medicine. IBDStrong helps patients make lifestyle changes that abide by complementary medicine techniques such as habit tracking. This project believes that patients can improve their quality of life by getting the power back. Their disease shouldn't run their lives —they should.<br><br>

For context, I was diagnosed with IBD just before the pandemic. This project is my way of giving back to the autoimmune community —through design.
